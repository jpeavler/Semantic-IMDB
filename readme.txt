Stretch questions:
Why should we structure HTML semantically for something like a login form? 
    It allows us to refer to the login form in our css and javascript easily.
What are some benefits of everyone using similar semantic HTML? 
    It allows collaborators to understand each other's code quickly
What are some disadvantages? 
    It limits freedom. It prevents us from coming up with potentially better
    ways to organize our code.
